Tear up the photographs
But yesterday won't let go
Every day every day every
minute
Here comes the emptiness
Just can't be lonely you know
Every day every day hey hey
This second-chancin's really
getting me down
You give and taking everything
I dreamed about
It's time you let me know let
me know just let go
All I ever wanted all I ever
wanted
Was a simple way to get over you
All I ever wanted all I ever
wanted
Was an in-between to escape
this desperate scene
Where every law reveals the
truth
Baby cause I all ever wanted
All I ever wanted was you
I'd rather walk alone
Don't wanna chase you around
Every day every day every minute
I thought a thousand times
For I let you drag me down
Every day every day hey hey
Your new beginning was a
perfect ending
But I keep feeling we've
already been here before
It's time you let me know let
me know just let go
All I ever wanted all I ever
wanted
Was a simple way to get over you
All I ever wanted all I ever
wanted
Was an in-between to escape
this desperate scene
Where every law reveals the
truth
Baby cause I all ever wanted
All I ever wanted was you
Tell me with so many out there
Why I always turn to you
Your goodbyes tear me down
every time
And it's so easy to see that
they'll blame this on me
All I ever wanted all I ever
wanted
Was a simple way to get over you
All I ever wanted all I ever
wanted
Was an in-between to escape
this desperate scene
Where every law reveals the
truth
Baby cause I all ever wanted
All I ever wanted was you
